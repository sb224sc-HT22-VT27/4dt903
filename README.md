# 4DT903 / 4DV651 | Project in Model-based development | 10hp | 01/09/2025 - 18/01/2026

[Example 1](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseEMF/article.html)

- from 1.1 to 1.5 (skip 1.6)
- (skip section 2 because you already have everything installed with the Eclipse Modeling Tools).
- Section 3. When you find the references to something called “genmodel" (in part 3.3), read Section 11 that explains how to create it. Anyhow, you already got a genmodel created by default in the beginning.
- Sections 4. 5, 6
- Section 8
- Sections 12, 13, 14 (we did not cover in the seminar the contents of 12 and 13; we will do it next week).
